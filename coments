0bf4318 net: Serve blocks directly from disk when possible (Wladimir J. van der Laan)

Pull request description:

  In `ProcessGetBlockData`, send the block data directly from disk if type MSG_WITNESS_BLOCK is requested. This is a valid shortcut as the on-disk format matches the network format.

  This is expected to increase performance because a deserialization and subsequent serialization roundtrip is avoided.
